## Quick Start

### Tips

It is recommended to develop the good habit of proactively checking for updates. Check back periodically for new releases, as they will include new features and bug fixes!

*Automatic update checking is planned*

The Dev branch has more cutting-edge features. If you are capable, you can download and try it yourself. However, the Dev branch does not provide precompiled versions and does not accept feedback.

Older versions are not supported. Please make sure you are using the latest version before reporting any issues!

If you need to use an older version, please download the documentation for that version. The documentation is only updated with the latest version, so it may not apply to older versions.

### System Requirements

- OS: Windows 11, Major Linux distributions

- It is strongly recommended to install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) on your system, otherwise you will only be able to use basic features.

**Note**: Without FFmpeg installed, the following features will be unavailable:
- Video generation
- Importing non-WAV audio files (WAV only)
- Output format selection (WAV only)
- Metadata functionality

Both packaged and source versions require FFmpeg for advanced features. **The packaged version does not include FFmpeg!**

For the source version, additional requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Installation

#### Packaged Version

**Recommended for regular users**

1. **Download the Packaged Version**

   Download the latest JimSMake release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Jimmy32767255/JimSMake/releases/latest) page.

   After downloading, extract the archive to your chosen directory.

   Optional: Verify file integrity (md5/sha1/sha256/sha512).

#### Source Installation

If you want to participate in development or debug/modify the code, you need the source version.

*(Source version is recommended for development only, not for regular users)*

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jimmy32767255/JimSMake.git
   cd JimSMake
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   *(It is recommended to install dependencies in a virtual environment)*

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you encounter missing portaudio.h header file issues when installing PyAudio, such as [this issue](https://github.com/Jimmy32767255/JimSMake/issues/1), you can refer to [this article](https://blog.csdn.net/zhang_zijun2/article/details/159652397) for a solution.
